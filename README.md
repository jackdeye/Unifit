## Summary
Have you ever wondered why clothes are so expensive when you will get just a few uses out of them? Whether it is a nice suit needed for a presentation or a dress for a single night out with friends, uses for expensive clothes can be few and far between. 

Unifit: a platform that allows university students to effortlessly buy, sell, and rent clothes or other dorm necessities on campus without the hassle of shipping over an item from a stranger. Our goal is to fight against fast fashion, promote sustainability, and cultivate a close-knit community on university campuses.
